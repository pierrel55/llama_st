The explanation for the existence of seasons is based on the Earth's tilt. The E
arth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees from its axis, which is the imaginary
 line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. This tilt causes the amou
nt of sunlight that reaches different parts of the Earth to vary throughout the
year.

During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted to
wards the sun, which results in longer days and more sunlight. This extra sunlig
ht causes the temperature to rise, leading to the warmer weather that we associa
te with summer.

In contrast, during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole
 is tilted away from the sun, which results in shorter days and less sunlight. T
his lack of sunlight causes the temperature to drop, leading to the colder weath
er that we associate with winter.

The same pattern occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, but with the opposite season
s. During the summer months in the Southern Hemisphere, the South Pole is tilted
 towards the sun, and during the winter months, the South Pole is tilted away fr
om the sun.
