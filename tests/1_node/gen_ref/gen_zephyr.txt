The explanation for the existence of seasons is based on the Earth's tilt. The E
arth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees from its axis of rotation. This tilt
causes the Earth's hemispheres to receive different amounts of solar radiation a
t different times of the year.

In the Northern Hemisphere, during the summer months, the tilt causes the sun's
rays to hit the Earth at a more direct angle, which results in longer days and m
ore sunlight. This extra sunlight causes the temperature to rise, resulting in w
armer weather and the growth of vegetation.

In the winter months, the tilt causes the sun's rays to hit the Earth at a less
direct angle, which results in shorter days and less sunlight. This lack of sunl
ight causes the temperature to drop, resulting in colder weather and the death o
f vegetation.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite is true. During the summer months, the
sun's rays hit the Earth at a less direct angle, resulting in shorter days and l
ess sunlight. This lack of sunlight causes the temperature to drop, resulting in
 colder weather and the death of vegetation.

In the winter months, the sun's rays hit the Earth at a more direct angle, resul
ting in longer days and more sunlight. This extra sunlight causes the temperatur
e to rise, resulting in warmer weather and the growth
