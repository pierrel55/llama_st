The explanation for the existence of seasons is a bit more complicated than the
simple explanation that the Earth is tilted. It's actually a combination of the
Earth's tilt and its orbit around the Sun.
The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees to the plane of its orbit
 around the Sun. This means that the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Su
n in summer and away from the Sun in winter. The southern hemisphere is tilted a
way from the Sun in summer and toward the Sun in winter.
The Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle. Instead, it's an ellip
se, or a stretched-out circle. The Sun is not at the center of the ellipse. It's
 at one of the foci, or the two points where the ellipse is widest.
The Earth is closer to the Sun in January than in July. The distance between the
 Earth and the Sun varies from about 91 million miles in January to about 94 mil
lion miles in July.
