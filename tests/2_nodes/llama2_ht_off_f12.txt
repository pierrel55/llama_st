The explanation for the existence of seasons is due to the tilt of the Earth's a
xis and its orbit around the sun.

The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to
 the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that, as the Earth orbits the
 sun, different parts of the planet are tilted towards or away from the sun, res
ulting in changes in the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface.

During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth is tilted towards
 the sun, resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight reaching the surface
. This leads to warmer temperatures and longer days.

In contrast, during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth is t
ilted away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and less direct sunlight reac
hing the surface. This leads to colder temperatures and shorter days.

The same process occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, but with the opposite season
s. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern He
misphere, and vice versa.
