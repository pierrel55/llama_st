The explanation for the existence of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted
at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane. This tilt causes diff
erent parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the y
ear, leading to the changing seasons. However, the Earth's axis is not fixed in
space, but rather it precesses, meaning it traces out a circle in the sky over a
 period of about 26,000 years. This precession affects the direction in which th
e Earth's axis points, and consequently, the position of the solstices and equin
oxes relative to the stars.

Given that the Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees, and it precesses over a p
eriod of 26,000 years, calculate the average rate of precession in degrees per y
ear. Additionally, determine the change in the position of the solstices relativ
e to the stars over a period of 13,000 years. To determine the average rate of p
recession in degrees per year, we start with the total precession period and the
 total angle of precession. The Earth's axis precesses in a circle over a period
 of 26,000 years, and the angle of precession is 360 degrees (since it completes
 one full circle).

The average rate of precession in degrees per year is given by:
\[
\text{Average rate of precession} = \frac{360 \text{ degrees}}{26,000 \text{ yea
rs}} = \frac{360}{26,000} \approx 0.013846 \text{ degrees per year}
\]

Next, we need to determine the change in the position of the solstices relative
to the stars over a period of 13,000 years. Since the Earth's axis precesses at
a rate of approximately 0.013846 degrees per year, the change in the position of
 the solstices over 13,000 years is:
\[
\text{Change in position} = 0.013846 \text{ degrees per year} \times 13,000 \tex
t{ years} = 180.00 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the change in the position of the solstices relative to the stars ove
r a period of 13,000 years is:
\[
\boxed{180 \text{ degrees}}
