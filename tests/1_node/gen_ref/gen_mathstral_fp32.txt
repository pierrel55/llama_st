The explanation for the existence of seasons is related to the Earth's tilt and
its orbit around the Sun.

Seasons occur because the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degre
es relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes the amoun
t of solar energy received by different parts of the Earth to vary throughout th
e year, leading to the different seasons.

During the summer, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, and the Tropic of C
ancer (23.5 degrees north latitude) receives the most direct sunlight. This caus
es the northern hemisphere to experience longer days and warmer temperatures, re
sulting in summer.

In the winter, the opposite happens. The North Pole is tilted away from the Sun,
 and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 degrees south latitude) receives the most dir
ect sunlight. This causes the southern hemisphere to experience longer days and
warmer temperatures, resulting in summer there, while the northern hemisphere ex
periences shorter days and colder temperatures, resulting in winter.
