The explanation for the existence of seasons is rooted in the Earth's tilt and o
rbit around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.5 degrees, which
causes the amount of sunlight that reaches the planet's surface to vary througho
ut the year. During the summer months, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards
 the Sun, resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight. Conversely, during
the winter months, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, resultin
g in shorter days and less direct sunlight.
This tilt is the primary cause of the changing seasons, with the Earth's orbit a
round the Sun also playing a role. The Earth's orbit is elliptical, meaning that
 its distance from the Sun varies throughout the year. However, the difference i
n distance has a minimal impact on the seasons, as the tilt of the Earth is the
dominant factor.
The four seasons that occur on Earth are:
1. **Spring**: Typically begins around March 20/21 in the Northern Hemisphere an
d September 22/23 in the Southern Hemisphere. During this season, the weather st
arts to warm up, and days get longer.
2. **Summer**: Begins around June 20/21 in the Northern Hemisphere and December
21/22 in the Southern Hemisphere. This season is characterized by long days, war
m temperatures, and often dry conditions.
3. **Autumn** (or **Fall**): Begins around September 22/23 in the Northern Hemis
phere and March 20/21 in the Southern Hemisphere. As the days shorten, temperatu
res cool, and leaves on trees change color before falling.
4. **Winter**: Begins around December 21/22 in the Northern Hemisphere and June
20/21 in the Southern Hemisphere. This season is marked by shorter days, colder
temperatures, and often snow and ice.

The seasonal variations have a significant impact on the environment, ecosystems
, and human societies. Understanding the causes of the seasons is essential for
predicting weather patterns, managing resources, and planning activities.
