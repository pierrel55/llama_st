The explanation for the existence of seasons is based on the tilt of the Earth's
 axis. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flattened at the poles
 and bulging at the equator. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted at an angle
of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This tilt is respons
ible for the variation in the amount of sunlight received by different parts of
the Earth, and therefore for the seasons.

During the summer solstice, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun and receive
s the most sunlight of any point on Earth. The sun is directly overhead at noon
at the Tropic of Cancer, which is located at 23.5 degrees north latitude. The da
ys are longest and the nights are shortest at this time, and the sun rises and s
ets in a northerly direction.

Conversely, during the winter solstice, the South Pole is tilted away from the s
un and receives the least sunlight of any point on Earth. The sun is directly ov
erhead at noon at the Tropic of Capricorn, which is located at 23.5 degrees sout
h latitude. The days are shortest and the nights are longest at this time, and t
he sun rises and sets in a southerly direction.

The tilt of the Earth's axis also causes the length of day and night to vary thr
oughout the year at different latitudes. At the equator, the length of day and n
ight is almost exactly 12 hours all year round, because the sun is directly over
head at noon. As you move towards the poles, the length of day and night becomes
 longer in the summer and shorter in the winter. At the poles, the sun does not
set at all during the summer solstice, and does not rise at all during the winte
r solstice
