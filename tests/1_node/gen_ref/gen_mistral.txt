The explanation for the existence of seasons is based on the tilt of the Earth's
 axis. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flattened at the poles
 and bulging at the equator. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted at an angle
of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This tilt is respons
ible for the variation in the amount of sunlight received by different parts of
the Earth, and therefore for the seasons.

During the summer solstice, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun and receive
s the maximum amount of sunlight, while the South Pole is tilted away and receiv
es the minimum amount of sunlight. Conversely, during the winter solstice, the N
orth Pole is tilted away from the sun and receives the minimum amount of sunligh
t, while the South Pole is tilted towards the sun and receives the maximum amoun
t of sunlight.

The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the sun to appear to move in a circular path
 across the sky, with the highest point of the path (the solar noon) moving nort
hward during the summer and southward during the winter. This movement of the so
lar noon is what causes the seasons.

During the summer, the solar noon is located further north, which means that the
 sun is higher in the sky and shines for a longer period of time. This results i
n warmer temperatures and longer days. During the winter, the solar noon is loca
ted further south, which means that the sun is lower in the sky and shines for a
 shorter period
